Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering Manager position at X-Team. With over 25 years of experience in engineering leadership and a proven track record of scaling high-performing teams in the SaaS and AI sectors, I am confident that my background aligns perfectly with X-Team’s mission to drive innovation for world-class companies.

Throughout my career, I have thrived in environments that require a balance of technical depth and strategic leadership. In my current role at Creare Sistemas SA, I scaled a team from 15 to 38 engineers in just 12 months, eventually overseeing the entire software portfolio. This experience taught me how to maintain high standards of code quality and team morale during periods of rapid growth—a challenge I know is central to the Engineering Manager role at X-Team.

My technical expertise spans across the stack, including Node.js, Python, and C++, with a deep specialization in R&D for AI and IoT. I have a long history of managing remote and international collaborations across the USA, Europe, and Asia, which has prepared me for the unique communication needs of a distributed, global organization like yours.

What draws me most to X-Team is your commitment to a developer-centric culture and your reputation for handling complex, large-scale projects. I am passionate about mentoring engineers, fostering a culture of ownership, and aligning technical roadmaps with business objectives to deliver measurable impact.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience in scaling teams and managing complex software portfolios can contribute to X-Team's continued success.

Best regards,

Gustavo Castro
