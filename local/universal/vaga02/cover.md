Dear Hiring Manager,

With over 25 years of experience leading high-impact engineering organizations and serving as a CTO and R&D Manager, I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering Leadership position at [Company Name]. My career has been defined by scaling engineering teams from the ground up and delivering complex SaaS, AI, and IoT solutions that drive business growth.

In my most recent role at Creare Sistemas, I scaled the engineering department from 15 to 38 members within a single year, while taking over the management of the entire software portfolio. At Ponfac, as CTO, I spearheaded the development of a No-Code Computer Vision platform and innovative AI algorithms, demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between deep technical research and commercial product viability.

My experience aligns perfectly with the requirements of your role:
* **Team Leadership:** Proven ability to lead cross-functional teams (HW/SW) and foster a culture of accountability.
* **Technical Vision:** Deep expertise in AI, Computer Vision, and SaaS architecture.
* **Global Perspective:** Extensive experience managing international projects and vendors in the USA, Europe, and Asia.

I am confident that my background in restructuring platforms for scale and my passion for mentorship will make me a valuable asset to your leadership team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my strategic approach to R&D can contribute to [Company Name]’s success.

Sincerely,

Gustavo Castro
