Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Manager, Software Engineering position at The Walt Disney Company.

I am a Senior Software Engineering leader with over 25 years of experience building, scaling, and modernizing enterprise technology platforms across AI, SaaS, and IoT domains. Throughout my career, I have led high-performing engineering organizations, defined software architecture and technical roadmaps, and partnered closely with product, operations, and executive stakeholders to deliver scalable, mission-critical systems.

While a significant portion of my leadership experience was developed in Brazil, my work has consistently involved global teams, international stakeholders, and enterprise-scale platforms operating across multiple regions. I am currently based in Central Florida (Orlando area), legally authorized to work in the United States, and available to start immediately.

I am particularly drawn to Disney’s focus on large-scale, reliable platforms and cross-functional collaboration. I believe my background in software engineering leadership, platform modernization, and team scaling aligns strongly with the needs of this role.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Disney’s engineering organization.

Sincerely,
Gustavo Castro
