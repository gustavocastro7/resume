Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Lead Data Product Engineer position for the Guest Profile team at Disney. With over 25 years of experience leading engineering teams and building complex, data-driven software solutions, I have developed a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic leadership that aligns perfectly with Disney’s commitment to delivering seamless and personalized guest experiences.

In my current role as Engineering Manager at Creare Sistemas, I oversee a multidisciplinary team of 38 engineers, where I am responsible for unifying a diverse portfolio of SaaS products. A core part of my work involves managing complex telemetry data systems—transforming vast amounts of raw data from heavy vehicle sensors into actionable safety and operational insights. This experience in creating cohesive data ecosystems and ensuring system interoperability is directly applicable to the challenges of managing a unified Guest Profile at Disney.

Throughout my career, I have successfully bridged the gap between highly technical engineering requirements and strategic product goals. Whether it was architecting Smart Grid solutions that handle millions of data points or developing AI-driven computer vision systems, my focus has always been on scalability, reliability, and the end-user experience. Furthermore, my background in international project management has equipped me with the communication skills necessary to collaborate with diverse stakeholders across global markets.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it sits at the intersection of data engineering and product innovation. I am eager to bring my experience in high-availability systems and engineering leadership to help Disney further enhance its Guest Profile capabilities and continue setting the gold standard for personalized entertainment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background in leading large-scale engineering initiatives can contribute to the continued success of the Disney Guest Experience.

Sincerely,

gustavo castro
