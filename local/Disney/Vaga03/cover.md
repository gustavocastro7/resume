Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering Manager position at Disney, as advertised on the Disney Careers portal. With over 25 years of experience in engineering leadership and a proven track record of scaling high-performing teams, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the innovative technology culture that Disney is known for.

In my most recent role as Engineering Manager at Creare Sistemas, I demonstrated my ability to scale organizations rapidly, growing a product team from 15 to 38 engineers in just one year. I oversaw the development of complex SaaS platforms and AI-driven hardware integrations, similar to the large-scale, guest-centric technologies utilized across Disney’s ecosystem. My background in AI, Computer Vision, and IoT aligns perfectly with the sophisticated technical requirements of Disney’s modern infrastructure.

Key highlights of my qualifications include:
* **Strategic Team Growth:** Expertise in hiring, mentoring, and managing cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software within tight deadlines.
* **Global Technical Leadership:** Extensive experience managing international projects and R&D initiatives across the USA, Germany, and China.
* **Full-Stack Innovation:** Deep technical proficiency in SaaS architecture, AI/Computer Vision (OpenCV), and hardware-software interoperability.

Living in Orlando, I have witnessed firsthand the impact of Disney’s technological excellence. I am eager to bring my experience in managing complex R&D projects and my passion for engineering excellence to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my leadership and technical background can support Disney’s mission of creating unparalleled experiences.

Sincerely,

Gustavo Castro
