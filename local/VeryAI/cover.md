Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Backend Engineer position. With over 25 years of experience in software engineering and technical leadership, I have developed a deep expertise in building scalable SaaS platforms, IoT integrations, and AI-driven backend systems that align with the requirements of this role.

In my recent role at Creare Sistemas SA, I managed a multidisciplinary team that grew from 15 to 38 engineers. Beyond leadership, I remained deeply involved in the technical architecture, spearheading a platform restructuring that focused on modularization and infrastructure improvement. My technical toolkit—including C#, Python, Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL—has allowed me to deliver robust solutions for complex industries such as agribusiness and industrial automation.

Key highlights of my background include:
* Developing high-performance backend architectures for Smart Grid and telemetry systems.
* Creating innovative AI and Computer Vision solutions, including a No-Code IDE for vision projects.
* Extensive international experience collaborating with teams in the USA, China, and Europe to deliver global tech products.
* A proven ability to bridge the gap between hardware and software, ensuring seamless data flow and system reliability.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of the focus on building impactful backend solutions. I am confident that my blend of deep technical knowledge and strategic engineering management makes me an ideal candidate to help your team scale its infrastructure and deliver high-quality products.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience can contribute to your engineering goals.

Sincerely,

Gustavo Castro
