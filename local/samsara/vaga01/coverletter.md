Dear Samsara Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Engineering Manager – Frontend Architecture & Developer Experience role. With more than 25 years in software engineering and leadership across SaaS and IoT platforms, I have built and scaled multidisciplinary engineering teams while driving platform architecture, developer productivity, and long-term technical strategy.

In my current role as Engineering Manager at Creare Sistemas, I lead cross-functional teams delivering AI safety camera systems and vehicle telemetry platforms—solutions closely aligned with Samsara’s mission of improving safety and operational efficiency in physical operations. I scaled the engineering organization from 15 to 38 engineers while leading platform restructuring initiatives focused on infrastructure evolution, component modularization, and user interface improvements to increase engineering efficiency and product consistency. I have also led platform teams responsible for shared tooling and standards, including teams developing web applications using React, where my focus was on architecture, scalability, and improving the developer experience across products.

Throughout my career as a R&D leader and Engineering Manager, I have consistently driven platform unification, architecture modernization, and engineering workflow improvements to enable teams to build and ship reliable software at scale. My background in IoT, telemetry systems, and SaaS platforms gives me a strong appreciation for the real-world impact of connected operations and the importance of building resilient, scalable systems that empower both engineers and customers.

What excites me most about Samsara is the opportunity to shape the future of frontend engineering in a company whose technology directly impacts industries that power the global economy. I am passionate about mentoring engineers, improving development workflows, and partnering across organizations to create sustainable technical foundations that enable long-term innovation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my leadership experience in platform engineering, developer productivity, and scalable SaaS and IoT systems can contribute to Samsara’s continued growth and engineering excellence.

Sincerely,
Gustavo Castro
