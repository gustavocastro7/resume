Dear Samsara Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Sr. Manager of Machine Learning – Safety AI role. With more than 25 years of experience leading engineering and R&D organizations delivering AI, computer vision, and industrial IoT solutions, I have built and scaled multidisciplinary teams responsible for intelligent edge systems, safety technologies, and large-scale SaaS platforms.

In my current role as Engineering Manager at Creare Sistemas, I lead teams of software engineers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and hardware engineers delivering AI safety camera systems and telemetry-driven operational platforms. Creare operates in a domain highly similar to Samsara’s — developing safety-focused hardware, intelligent devices, and SaaS platforms that combine video analytics, telemetry, and operational data to improve safety and real-world operations. I oversee the full machine learning lifecycle, including data pipelines, training, validation, edge inference deployment, and continuous iteration of models delivering real-time safety insights.

Previously, as CTO and R&D Manager at Ponfac, I led teams delivering computer vision and AI solutions for industrial environments, including image-based analytics and a No-Code computer vision platform integrating OpenCV and machine learning models into a unified development ecosystem. Throughout my career, I have consistently built AI-enabled systems that combine hardware, software, and operational data to deliver actionable intelligence in physical environments.

What excites me most about Samsara is the opportunity to help scale Safety AI systems that directly impact worker safety and operational efficiency across global industries. I am passionate about building strong teams, advancing AI platforms, and delivering practical machine learning solutions that generate measurable customer value at scale.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in AI safety systems, computer vision, edge AI, IoT platforms, and engineering leadership can contribute to Samsara’s Safety AI organization.

Sincerely,
Gustavo Castro
