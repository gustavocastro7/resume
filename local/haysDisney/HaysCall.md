# Presentation
With 25 years of experience, I have evolved from hands-on software engineering to leading engineering teams of up to 38 people on SaaS, IoT, and AI/Computer Vision projects.
At Creare Sistemas (most recent position), I expanded a team from 15 to 38 people in one year, involved in all software products, including security cameras with artificial intelligence, telemetry for heavy vehicles in agribusiness (sugar cane/timber), and real-time data generation for analysis. I was responsible for the entire product lifecycle: architecture, development, quality control, and product management.
Previously, at Ponfac, as Technical Leadership Manager, I designed no-code computer vision systems, integrating OpenCV and custom AI SDKs, as well as algorithms such as area-to-weight conversion for livestock images from high-quality AI-processed images.

# Important Projetcs
Modernizing the IoT SaaS platform from a legacy Java technology to a more recent version of Java, Node, and Next.
I worked on the architecture concept, microservices, and new UI/UX.

# Important Projetcs
The use of a computer vision system with AI in an animal feeding robot involved integrating a system for taking photos, detecting animal behavior, and sending the results to a SaaS platform.
This was primarily used for animals that were not coming to feed, generating an alert at the farm so that the situation could be investigated.

# Important Projetcs
