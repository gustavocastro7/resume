Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Manager, Software Engineering position at Circle. With over 25 years of experience leading engineering teams and a deep background in scaling complex SaaS and IoT platforms, I am confident in my ability to drive technical excellence and foster the high-performance culture required for Circle’s mission of building a more open and inclusive financial system.

In my most recent role as Engineering Manager at Creare Sistemas SA, I successfully scaled an engineering organization from 15 to 38 members in a single year. My focus was not only on recruitment but on restructuring the platform for better modularization and establishing rigorous agile processes that increased delivery speed without sacrificing quality. This experience aligns closely with Circle's need for leaders who can manage multidisciplinary teams—from backend and frontend to data science—while maintaining a strategic focus on business goals.

My background in R&D and Software Architecture has equipped me to handle the complexities of high-scale systems. Whether developing AI-driven computer vision systems or architecting smart grid infrastructures, I have consistently prioritized security, reliability, and technical mentorship. I am passionate about coaching engineers to solve difficult problems and ensuring that technical strategies are built for long-term scalability.

Circle’s reputation for transparency and innovation is incredibly compelling. I am eager to bring my global perspective, gained through projects in the USA, China, and Germany, to help Circle continue its impressive growth. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my leadership and technical background can benefit your engineering organization.

Sincerely,

Gustavo Castro
