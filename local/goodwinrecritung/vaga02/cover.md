Dear Mr. Clemmons,

I am applying for the Senior Embedded Software Engineer position (Job ID: 166759). I bring 25 years of experience developing embedded software for industrial automation systems, including direct integration between embedded C/C++ software and FPGA-based hardware platforms.

At ALTUS SA, I led development of programmable controllers and industrial automation systems, integrating embedded software with FPGA hardware. I also developed fault-tolerant systems for oil platforms, focusing on reliability and high availability in critical environments. My experience includes TCP/IP networking, industrial communication protocols, and system architecture design for complex embedded platforms.

I am very interested in contributing my embedded systems and hardware integration expertise to your engineering team and supporting the development of robust Linux-based embedded solutions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Gustavo Castro
