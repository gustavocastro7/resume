## Success Stories

### 1. Creare Sistemas – Platform Unification
- **Situation:** When I joined Creare, the company had several software products that were separate and not connected. This made it difficult for customers to use multiple solutions and for the company to manage updates and improvements efficiently.
- **Task:** I was responsible for unifying the products into a single, cohesive platform and improving the structure to make it easier to maintain and scale.
- **Action:** I managed a team of 38 engineers across software, hardware, and data science. I led the planning, design, and implementation of platform integration, while coordinating with product owners and stakeholders to ensure the changes met customer and business needs.
- **Result:** The company now has a single SaaS platform that is easier to use and manage. This improved user experience, reduced maintenance effort, and made it easier to add new features and scale the platform for future growth.

### 2. Ponfac – No-Code Computer Vision IDE
- **Situation:** At Ponfac, our customers and internal teams faced difficulties using AI and computer vision tools. The process was too technical and slow, which limited productivity and adoption.
- **Task:** I needed to create a solution that would make AI and computer vision projects easier to develop and use, even for non-technical users.
- **Action:** I designed and developed a No-Code Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This platform integrated our proprietary SDK, OpenCV, and other AI tools into a single user-friendly interface. I coordinated the development team, defined features, and tested the system to ensure it worked correctly for different projects.
- **Result:** The IDE allowed teams to deploy projects much faster and reduced development time significantly. Customers could now create AI solutions without deep technical knowledge, increasing adoption and satisfaction.

### 3. Safety AI Cameras & Telemetry
- **Situation:** In industrial and transport sectors, clients needed reliable monitoring systems for safety and operational data. The existing solutions were not flexible or integrated with other systems.
- **Task:** I had to lead the development of a complete product solution, from the hardware cameras to software platforms for telemetry and analytics.
- **Action:** I oversaw the end-to-end product development, coordinating engineering teams to design hardware, software, and data systems. I also ensured the deployment met quality standards and customer requirements. I worked closely with customers to understand their needs and adjust features accordingly.
- **Result:** The Safety AI cameras and telemetry systems were successfully deployed, providing clients with accurate, actionable data. This improved operational safety, helped in decision-making, and strengthened the company’s reputation in the industry.
