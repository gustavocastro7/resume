## Summary

I am a highly accomplished and results-driven Senior Engineering Manager and R&D Leader with a distinguished 25-year track record in building and scaling high-performing, cross-functional teams. My expertise lies in delivering innovative software and hardware solutions from concept to launch, with a deep specialization in SaaS, AI/Computer Vision, and IoT technologies.

Throughout my career, I've demonstrated a proven ability to significantly grow engineering organizations, notably expanding a single product team from 15 to 38 engineers in one year and later overseeing an entire company's software portfolio. I've led complex initiatives globally, including the development of advanced AI algorithms, No-Code computer vision systems, and critical platform restructuring to enhance infrastructure and user experience. My extensive international project experience spans the USA, Germany, and China, providing a broad perspective on global tech challenges.

As a collaborative leader and technical educator, I am passionate about driving both product excellence and team growth. I thrive in environments where technology, strategy, and mentorship intersect, fostering a culture of ownership, accountability, and continuous improvement. My focus is always on aligning technical strategy with strategic business objectives to deliver measurable and significant impact for the team and the business.
