Hi [Hiring Manager Name],

As an Engineering Manager with a specialized background in AgTech, Industrial IoT, and Computer Vision, I have followed [Company Name]’s work in [Specific Product/Tech] for some time.

Recently moving to Florida from a background leading R&D for industrial tech firms, I bring specific expertise in deploying high-reliability software for connected devices and safety systems. Most recently, I led the delivery of an AI-powered fleet telemetry platform and scaled the supporting engineering team by over 100% in 12 months.

I am eager to apply my experience in bridging hardware limitations with SaaS scalability to the challenges your team is solving today.

Best,

Gustavo Castro
