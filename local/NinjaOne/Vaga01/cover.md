Dear Hiring Team at NinjaOne,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering Manager position at NinjaOne. With over 25 years of experience in software engineering and R&D leadership, including more than a decade leading distributed engineering teams and large-scale client-server systems, I bring deep expertise in SaaS platforms, IoT architectures, and scalable system design.

Currently, as Engineering Manager at Creare Sistemas SA, I lead cross-functional teams across backend, frontend, hardware, and data science. I manage the full software development lifecycle for a SaaS platform serving telemetry and AI-based solutions. Over the past year, I scaled the engineering organization from 15 to 38 engineers while expanding oversight to all company software products. My responsibilities include architectural improvements, platform restructuring, security practices, telemetry data reliability, and close collaboration with product and research teams.

Previously, I led Smart Grid distributed systems projects, industrial fault-tolerant systems, and AI-driven computer vision solutions. My background includes designing scalable client-server architectures, managing embedded and cloud-connected systems, and driving engineering process improvements aligned with business strategy.

I am particularly motivated by NinjaOne’s mission to deliver scalable endpoint management solutions to thousands of customers. My experience leading distributed teams, improving engineering operations, mentoring developers, and driving continuous system improvement aligns strongly with the requirements of this role.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to NinjaOne’s continued growth and product excellence.

Sincerely,

Gustavo Castro
