**RE: Software Engineering Manager**

Dear NinjaOne Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering Manager position at NinjaOne. With over 25 years of experience in engineering leadership and a proven track record of scaling teams and delivering complex SaaS solutions, I am confident that I can help NinjaOne continue its trajectory as a leader in IT management software.

Throughout my career, I have excelled at the intersection of technical strategy and people management. In my current role at Creare Sistemas, I demonstrated my ability to scale organizations by growing a team from 15 to 38 engineers in a single year. This growth required not only technical oversight of SaaS and AI products but also the implementation of robust agile processes and a culture of extreme ownership—values that I know NinjaOne holds in high regard.

My background aligns closely with the requirements of this role:
* **Scalable Leadership:** Experience managing the entire software portfolio of a company, ensuring that engineering efforts directly support business growth.
* **Technical Depth:** A career built on solid foundations in C++, Python, and SaaS architecture, allowing me to engage deeply with senior engineers on technical challenges.
* **Innovation & Execution:** Proven ability to lead R&D initiatives, including AI and IoT integrations, while maintaining a focus on high-quality, predictable delivery.

I am particularly drawn to NinjaOne because of your commitment to building "relentlessly high-quality software." My experience in fault-tolerant systems and industrial-grade automation has instilled in me a "ship-once-and-ship-right" mentality that is essential for mission-critical IT tools.

I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience in building high-performing teams and scalable platforms can contribute to NinjaOne’s success. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Gustavo Castro
