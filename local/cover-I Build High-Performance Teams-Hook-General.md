Hi [Recruiter Name/Team],

I am a Senior Engineering Manager based in Florida with over 20 years of experience building and scaling software teams for SaaS, IoT, and AI platforms. I understand you are growing the engineering organization at [Company Name], which is why I am reaching out.

In my most recent role, I successfully scaled an engineering department from 15 to 38+ engineers in under a year while simultaneously delivering critical platform modernizations and AI-integrated products. I specialize in bridging the gap between business strategy and technical execution, ensuring teams deliver velocity without burning out.

I would love to briefly discuss how my experience in scaling teams and handling complex technical roadmaps can bring value to [Company Name].

Best regards,
